This blog exists for me to shill my various side projects and muse about software. I've never been one to regularly write but I find myself with plenty of spare time so I will try and make regular contributions. 

Since this blog is software I'll talk about it. It's written in NextJS and hosted on a Digital Ocean Kubernetes Cluster that hosts/will host other projects. Because I believe in GitOps this blog doesn't need a log in feature content is managed as code.

There is a Continuous Integration workflow hosted at [argo-workflows.fugue-state.io](https://argo-workflows.fugue-state.io) There also exists a declarative GitOps Continuous Delivery process at [argocd.fugue-state.io](https://argocd.fugue-state.io) The Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery processes are decoupled and release requires an application in [GitHub fugue-state-io/helm-charts](https://github.com/fugue-state-io/helm-charts).
