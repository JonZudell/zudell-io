ArgoCD manages collections of kubernetes resources by way of helm or kustomize. Since ArgoCD is itself a collection of kubernetes resources ArgoCD can manage it's own deployment. An example repository can be found here [fugue-state-io/helm-charts](https://github.com/fugue-state-io/helm-charts). In order for ArgoCD to manage itself we must initially bootstrap Argo into our cluster. In order to bootstrap argo with `helm` one must add the argo helm chart repo then install the argo-cd helm chart. An appropriate `values.yaml` will need to be created following this guide [argo/argo-cd](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/tree/main/charts/argo-cd)

```
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm install -f values.yaml argo-cd argo/argo-cd
```
